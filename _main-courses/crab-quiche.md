In blender (or bowl) mix: 

2 eggs 
1 cup (8oz) sour cream  
1 cup cottage cheese  
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese  
4 drops Tabasco sauce   
4 tablespoons flour  
1 teaspoon onion powder  
dash salt 

Pour into large bowl. 

Stir in: 
sauteed mushrooms, if desired  
2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese (1/2 pound)  
6 oz fresh or frozen crab meat (thawed and drained) or use imitation crab.   

Pour into 9 or 10 inch quiche dish or pie plate. Bake 45 minutes, at 350 degrees, or until knife 
comes out clean. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting into 8 wedges. 

This freezes well. Also try, baking individual quiches in a muffin tin (no paper liners), then freeze 
and use as needed. 

You may substitute 1 cup diced cooked ham for the crab.  Or try vegetables.  If using frozen vegetables, add them in last or your mixture will freeze up.  Or try hash browns and crumbled bacon.
