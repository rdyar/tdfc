Butt (or Shank) cut ham  
Whole cloves  
1 large can pineapple rings 

Trim off rind and as much fat from ham as possible. Place ham on a rack in baking dish. Add 
water to cover bottom of pan. After baking ham at 325 degrees for 1 hour, remove ham and trim 
any further fat and coat with glaze (below). Poke several cloves in ham and attach pineapple 
slices with toothpicks. Return to oven to continue cooking, 20 minutes per pound. Add more 
water to bottom of pan if necessary. If pineapple starts to burn, cover top with foil. 

Use leftovers in Ham & Beans, Ham & Potato casserole, and sandwiches. 

**MUSTARD GLAZE FOR HAM**

1 teaspoon flour  
1 teaspoon brown sugar   
1 teaspoon mustard  
1 teaspoon pineapple juice 

Mix all ingredients together and spread over ham part way through cooking. Vary ingredients to 
reach a paste consistency.
