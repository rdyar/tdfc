2 chickens, 3-3 1/2 lbs each 
2 cans beer (1/2 full) 
2 Tablespoons brown sugar  
2 Tablespoons paprika 
1 Tablespoon salt & pepper 
1 tsp garlic powder 
1 tsp cayenne pepper 

Bourbon Butter Glaze:  
In a small sauce pan, melt 6 Tablespoons butter with 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2 Tablespoons bourbon,  
1/2 lemon-juiced, and a little salt & pepper 

Directions 

Wash and pat dry the chicken.

Combine remaining/dry ingredients for a rub. 

Rub 2 Tablespoons of the dry rub all over one chicken and inside the cavity. Repeat on second chicken with remaining rub. 

If there is any rub left you can stir it into the can. 

Spray the outside of the beer cans with baking spray for easier removal. 

Insert the can into the chicken so that its legs are balanced with the can, like a tripod! 

Set this on a baking sheet and put it on the preheated grill over indirect heat. 

Cook covered for about 1 1/2 hours basting with bourbon glaze every 15 min. 

Chicken is done when thermometer reads 175Â° and legs move easily. 

Very carefully remove pan and with tongs and with a little help remove chicken from the can. 

Let rest 10 min. before carving. 

For an extra moist chicken you can brine it.  
Combine 1 cup Kosher salt and 2 gallons water. Soak chicken for 4 hours in the refrigerator. 
Chicken can be brined 4 hours to overnight, use a large soup pot so it will be covered entirely.
