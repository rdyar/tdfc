Oven roast or pot roast  
1-2 onions, peeled and quartered  
2-5 carrots, peeled and cut into 4 inch lengths  
1-3 medium potatoes, peeled and cut in medium size pieces  
Dry onion soup mix 

Place roast in pan and place vegetables around meat in the pan. Cover with foil and cook at 325 
degrees until done (about 1/2 hour per pound or 3-4 hours). Or use Schilling oven cooking bag 
with mix for Pot Roast-follow directions. 

You can also do this in a crock pot. Put vegetables in first, then seasoned meat (salt and 
pepper) and about 1/2 cup of beef consume. 

Make sure to cook a larger roast than needed so there is plenty leftover. Use leftovers for hash, 
soup, roast beef sandwiches, bbq sandwiches, french dip sandwiches. And dad's tacos!

You can leave vegetables whole instead of cutting them up. Use 1 each per person.
