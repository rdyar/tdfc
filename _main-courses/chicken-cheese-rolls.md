3 large chicken breasts, skinned, boned and split  
8 oz whipped cream cheese with chives, divided into 6 pieces  
1 tablespoon butter, divided into 6  
6 slices bacon 

Place split breasts between waxed paper; pound (individually) to 1/2 inch thickness. Spread each with about 3 
tablespoons cheese mixture; dot with 1/2 teaspoon butter. Fold ends over filling (some will ooze 
out during baking). Wrap 1 slice bacon around each roll. Place, seam side down, in shallow 
baking pan. Bake on top rack in 400 degree oven 40 minutes or until chicken is tender and 
juices run clear. Broil about 5 minutes or until bacon is crisp and golden. 

This dish can be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated until ready to bake.
