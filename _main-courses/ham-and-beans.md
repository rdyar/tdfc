Leftover ham and ham bone  
1 package navy beans or white beans (soaked over night or cooked)  
1 onion, quartered   
salt, pepper, garlic salt to taste 


Place ham bone in deep pan and cover about 3/4 of the bone with water Cook about 1 hour to 
cook off any fat. Pour off water and discard. Remove ham and bone to a plate and trim off fat 
and gristle. Return good pieces and bone to pan. Add beans (soaked overnight in 5" of water, or 
cooked 1 hour already). Cover beans with water Add onion and salt and pepper and garlic salt. 
Bring to high heat then simmer 4-5 hours. Stir occasionally. Remove bone and ugly pieces of 
meat. Pour off any excess liquid. Serve with bread and salad for a complete dinner. Some 
Dyars like to top with ketchup or salsa.

If cooking in the crock pot, needs several hours on high to cook beans.
