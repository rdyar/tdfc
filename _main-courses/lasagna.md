Leftover Spaghetti sauce, about 3 cups (may need more)  
oregano and garlic salt to taste  
8 Lasagna noodles, pre-cooked (they grow when cooked)  
8-16 oz Cottage cheese or Ricotta cheese  
2-3 cups shredded Mozzarella cheese  
Parmesan cheese 

Grease 9x13 Pyrex dish (or any size dish, adjusting ingredients to fit). Season spaghetti sauce 
with additional spices. Spoon thin layer of sauce over bottom of pan. Layer lasagna noodles, 
cottage or ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese and spaghetti sauce. Repeat one time. Sprinkle 
top with grated Parmesan cheese and more mozzarella cheese, if you like. Bake uncovered at 
325 degrees for about 40 minutes-until it looks bubbly and starting to brown. Let stand 10 
minutes and serve. 

OK to freeze this dish before cooking. Then thaw partially and cook.
