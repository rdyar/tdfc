3/4 stick margarine  
1/3 cup flour  
dash salt  
1 teaspoon onion powder  
1 1/2 cup milk  
few drops of red pepper seasoning  
1 1/2 cups grated cheeses (any combination of hard cheeses)  
3 eggs, separated  

Melt margarine in medium sauce pan. Stir in flour, salt, and onion powder, stirring constantly 
until mixture bubbles 1 minute. Stir in milk and red pepper seasoning. Continue to cook and stir 
until mixture thickens and bubbles 1 minute. Stir in cheese until melted. Let cool while beating 
eggs: beat egg whites until they form soft peaks. In a small bowl, beat egg yolks with a fork. Stir 
in a little bit of the cheese sauce until smooth, then stir this mixture into remaining cheese sauce. 
Fold this mixture into egg whites very gently until well blended. 

Pour into ungreased 6 cup souffle or straight sided baking dish. Fold a piece of foil in half 
lengthwise and wrap around dish to make a 3 inch stand up collar. Draw knife in a deep circle in 
center of souffle so it will puff up high. Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until 
firm and golden. Serve immediately.
