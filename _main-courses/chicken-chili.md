2 cups chopped onions  
4 cloves garlic, minced  
2 Tbsp olive oil  
1 4.5-oz can diced green chiles  
3 tsp chili powder  
1 tsp dried oregano, crushed  
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper  
3 15-oz cans white kidney beans, rinsed and drained  
2 14.5-oz cans reduced-sodium chicken broth  
5 cups cubed coooked turkey or chicken  
4 oz Monterey Jack cheese with jalapeno peppers, shredded

In Dutch oven, cook onions and garlic in hot oil over medium heat for 5-6 minutes, stirring often.  Cook until tender.
Stir in chiles, chili powder, oregano, and cayenne.  Cook 1 minute.  
Mash one can of beans, add all beans and broth to Dutch oven. Bring to simmering.
Cook, covered, 10 minutes.

Stir in turkey or chicken; cook about 10 minutes or until heated through.  Stir in cheese until melted.

Makes 8 to 10 servings.  

Freezes well.


Notes: 
I found 5 cups of chicken to be way too much.  I use about half of that, or maybe add in more beans and broth.  I make this recipe with plain old regular Monterey Jack cheese.  It's good served with diced avocado and additional cheese.  -- Deb
