Turkey giblets, to make broth  
1 stalk celery, chopped  
1/2 onion, chopped  
1/2 to 1 cup chicken or turkey broth (May need to add a bit more broth so that mixture sticks together.)  
4 tablespoons butter  
1/2 box of prepackaged seasoned stuffing mix  
stale bread crumbs, approximately 4 cups  
1 egg, beaten  

Cook giblets. Save broth to add to stuffing (strain and cool). (Extra broth can be used in making 
gravy.) Combine celery, onion and broth. Microwave on high until cooked. Add butter and let 
melt and cool. 

Mix together bread crumbs and packaged mix. Add broth mixture and egg and mix together. 
Mixture should not be too soggy nor too dry. Add more bread to dry out or more broth to 
moisten. 

Stuff turkey or chicken or place on top of a porkchop. When mom makes a turkey, she 
sometimes makes extra stuffing to bake separately in a casserole dish. If baking separately, 
bake at 325 degrees (if in a glass dish) for 40 minutes.
