1 large can fruit cocktail, well drained  
8 oz sour cream  
1 cup mini marshmallows, approximately  
coconut to taste  

Mix all ingredients. Best if made the day before needed so ingredients mix together well. 

This recipe has many different variations. It can be made with any type of fruit. Use whatever 
you like. It usually has pineapple and coconut in it. 

Mom always uses sour cream, however, you can use sour cream or cool whip to hold it together. 
Some recipes call for only sugar or powdered sugar, or nothing at all. It is best made ahead of 
time.
