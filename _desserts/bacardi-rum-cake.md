1 cup chopped pecans or walnuts  
1 (18 1/2oz) package yellow cake mix*  
1 package Jell-O Vanilla Instant Pudding and Pie Filling (3 3/4oz)  
4 eggs*   
1/2 cup cold water   
1/2 cup oil*  
1/2 cup Bacardi dark rum (80 proof)  

Grease and flour 10" tube or 12 cup bundt pan. Sprinkle nuts over bottom of pan. Mix remaining 
ingredients together. Pour batter over nuts. Bake 1 hour at 325 degrees. Cool. Invert on 
serving plate. Prick top with a fork. 

Glaze: Melt 1 stick of butter in a sauce pan. Stir in 1/4 cup water and 1 cup sugar. Boil 5 
minutes stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Stir in 1/2 cup Bacardi dark rum (80 proof). 
Spoon and brush glaze evenly over top and sides. Allow cake to absorb glaze. Repeat until 
glaze us gone. May need to reduce the glaze recipe as it makes a lot of glaze-may not need to 
use so much. 

\* If using yellow cake mix with pudding in the mix, omit instant pudding and use 3 eggs instead of 
4 eggs, 1/3 cup of oil instead of 1/2 cup
