1/2 cup stout (Guinness)  
12 oz choclolate chips (semi-sweet or dark or a combo of both)  
1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks)  
1 1/2 cups sugar  
3 eggs  
1 teaspoon vanilla  
3/4 cup all purpose flour  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 oz chocolate to grate over the warm brownies (optional)  

Line a 9x9 baking pan with parchment paper.  

In a medium saucepan, bring the stout to boil and cook until reduced to 1/4 cup, about 5-7 minutes.  Let cool.

In a medium bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water, add the choclolate and butter.  Whisk/stir until melted and smooth.

Preheat oven to 350F.

In a mixing bowl, with the paddle attachment on, beat on low speed: sugar, eggs, and vanilla.  Gradually pour in melted chocolate
and the cooled reduced stout.  Fold in flour and salt.    Pour batter into prepared pan.

Bake brownies for about 40 minutes or until the top begins to crack.  Remove the pan from the oven and let cool completely 
at room temperature.  Optional:  grate 1 oz of chocolate over the brownies as soon as they come out of the oven.

Once brownies are cooled, cut into 20 bars. 

These are very rich and yummy!

Freezer friendly.
