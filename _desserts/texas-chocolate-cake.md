1 stick margarine   
4 tablespoons cocoa  
1/2 cup cooking oil  
1 cup water  
2 eggs  
1/2 cup buttermilk

Mix baking soda, sugar and flour in large mixing bowl. Bring to a boil margarine, cocoa, oil and water (or 
do in microwave). Gradually pour over dry ingredients and mix. Add eggs, buttermilk and vanilla. 
Mix and bake in large ungreased jelly-roll pan at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes. Let cool then ice. 

Icing: 

1 stick margarine  
6 tablespoons buttermilk

Ok to double recipe and use 2 jelly roll pans. Freezes well.


2019 update:  
use 1 1/2 cups sugar (instead of 2) and reduce powdered sugar in icing to 3 1/2 cups.
