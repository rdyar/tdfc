1 cup unsifted flour  
1/2 cup butter, softened  
3 oz cream cheese, softened  
1 egg  
I/2 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed  
6 tablespoons finely chopped pecans  
dash salt  
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract  
1 teaspoon melted butter  
32 pecan halves for garnish, if desired  

In medium mixer bowl with electric mixer at medium speed, combine first 3 ingredients. Divide 
dough and shape into 32 balls. Place on ungreased cookie sheet. Make deep indentation with 
floured knuckle into each cookie and shape with fingers into bowl shape. Place in freezer for 10-15 
minutes or in refrigerator for 1 hour to firm.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 

Meanwhile, in small bowl mix egg and remaining ingredients except pecan halves. Set aside. After cookies are 
firm, fill each indentation with about 1 teaspoon pecan mixture and top with an additional pecan 
half if desired.

Bake for 30 minutes or until lightly browned.
