1 box Devil’s Food or other flavor* cake mix  
2 eggs  
¼ C hot coffee or hot water  
¼ C oil  
2 T flour  
½ C oats  
1 C chocolate chips  
1 C chopped nuts of your choice  

*Instead of chocolate mix you could use yellow mix and add raisins,
craisins, peanut butter – your experiment!

Mix ingredients by hand or mixer and stir in chips and nuts – dough will be stiff/sticky; can add     1 T milk if needed.  Drop by tablespoons onto ungreased cookie sheet or use parchment paper.

Bake at 350 degrees for 12 – 15 minutes.  Let cookies set for 4 or 5 minutes then transfer to cooling rack.  Store or freeze in airtight container.
Makes 3 to 4 dozen cookies.
