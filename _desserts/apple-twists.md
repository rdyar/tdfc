2 large apples (maybe even 3 for some extras), peeled and cored  
1 can Pillsbury Refrigerated Quick Crescent Dinner Rolls  
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted  
1/3 cup sugar  (little less is still plenty)
1 teaspoon cinnamon  
1/4 cup orange juice or water  

Cut each apple into eight pieces. Unfold crescent roll dough; separate into 8 triangles. Cut each 
in half lengthwise to make 16 triangle strips. Place an apple piece at wide end of each strip; roll 
up. Arrange in 9x13 pan. Drizzle with butter, sprinkle with mixture of cinnamon and 
sugar. Pour orange juice into pan, but not over dough. Bake at 400 degrees for 30-35 minutes, 
or until apples are tender. Serve warm, plain or with ice cream. 

Mom adds more apples to the pan to fill in all the spaces and more juice (almost double).
