1 teaspoon ginger  
1 16 oz can pumpkin  
1 teaspoon cinnamon  
2/3 cups water  
1 cup oil  
2 teaspoon baking soda  
1 teaspoon nutmeg  
3 cups flour  
3 cups sugar  
1 cup nuts, chopped   
5 eggs  
1 cup raisins  
1 1/2 teaspoon salt  

Beat together ginger, cinnamon, oil, nutmeg, sugar, eggs and salt. Beat at low speed then high 
for 2 minutes. 

Add remaining ingredients, in order listed. 

Grease and flour well 4-1 pound coffee cans, or 2 large loaf pans, or several smaller cans. Fill 
cans 1/2 full with batter and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour (smaller cans bake for about 25 
minutes). Test with broom straw (or toothpick), it should come out clean. Put plastic lid on can 
or cover with foil after removing from oven. This will steam the bread. When cool, refrigerate or 
freeze.
