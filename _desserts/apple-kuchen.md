1/2 cup butter, softened  
1 package yellow cake mix  
1 cup flaked coconut  
1 can (20 oz) pie sliced apples, well drained (or 2 1/4 cups sliced pared apples)  
1/2 cup sugar  
1 teaspoon cinnamon  
1 cup sour cream  
2 egg yolks or 1 egg  

Cut butter into cake mix until crumbly. Mix in coconut. Pat mixture lightly into 9x13 pan, building 
up slight edges. Bake 10 minutes at 350 degrees. Arrange apple slices on warm crust. Mix 
sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle on apples. Blend sour cream and egg yolks; drizzle over apples. 
(Topping will not completely cover apples.) Bake 25 minutes or until edges are light brown. Do 
not over bake. Serve warm. 

Can also make this recipe using peaches. Substitute 1 29oz can drained peach slices for apples 
and white cake mix for yellow mix. OK to omit coconut.
