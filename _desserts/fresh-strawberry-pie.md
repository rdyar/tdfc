1 pie shell, baked and sprinkled with powdered sugar  
1 cup sugar (or reduce to 1/2 cup)  
1 cup water  
3 tablespoons cornstarch  
3 tablespoons strawberry Jell-O (a small 3oz package is 6 Tbsp)  
1 or 2 boxes fresh strawberries, washed and cleaned  
whipped cream  

Cook sugar, water and cornstarch, stirring constantly, until thick. Add Je11-0. Line (baked and cooled) pie shell with berries. 
Cover with the sauce. Refrigerate until mixture sets. Top with whipped cream. 

Use leftover Jell-O mix for another pie, or figure out ratios and make Jell-O. 

2019 update - use 1/2 cup of sugar
