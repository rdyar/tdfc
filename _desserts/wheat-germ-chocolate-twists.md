Cookie:  
2/3 cup whole natural almonds  
1 3/4 cups flour  
1 cup wheat germ, regular or sugar and honey  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
1 cup butter, softened (2 cubes)  
1/4 cup sugar  
1/2 teaspoon almond or vanilla extract  
(this is really too dry; there appears to be a margin note to add milk "1T")  
(I added about 2 Tbsp of NF milk to get the dough to a texture that could be formed)  

Grind almonds, stop-and-go fashion, in electric blender until amonds are chopped fine.  
Combine with flour, wheat germ and salt.  
Beat together butter, sugar and extract.  Blend dry ingredients.  
Roll dough into 1/2 inch thick ropes. Cut into 3 inch lenghts.  Cross two lengths to make an "X" on ungreased baking sheet.  Move ends close together.
Repeat with remaining lengths.  
Bake in 350 degree oven 15 to 17 minutes or until lightly browned.  Remove from baking sheet.  Cool on rack.  
Dip both ends of cookies in Chocolate Glaze.  Let dry on rack.  Makes about three dozen cookies.


Chocolate Glaze:  
2 ounces semi-sweet chocolate (about 1/2 cup choc chips)  
2 tablespoons butter  
Melt ingredients over very low heat, stirring occasionally  

Tips:  
Freeze cookies before dipping in chocolate.
Make cookies any shape you like...circles, sticks, crescents.  Cooking times may vary.
