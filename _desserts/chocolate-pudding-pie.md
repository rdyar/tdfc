1/4 cup cocoa powder  
1 1/2 cup sugar  
5 T flour  
1/2 tsp salt  
3 beaten egg yolks (I think Iâ€™ve used 1 egg + 1 yolk)  
scant 2 cups milk  
2 tsp vanilla  
2 T butter  

Combine cocoa, sugar, flour & salt in a heavy saucepan.  
Add egg, milk & vanilla.  Cook over low heat, stirring frequently for about 10 min. or until mixture thickens.  
Remove from heat & stir in butter.  Let cool a bit before pouring into pie shell.  

Top with whipped cream.
