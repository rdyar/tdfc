3 large eggs  
3/4 cup granulated sugar  
1 Tbsp lemon zest  
1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (2-3 lmeons for both zest and juice)  
1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces  

In a medium heatproof bowl, place eggs, sugar, lemon zest and juice and whisk to combine.   
Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (bain-marie).  Cook on moderate heat, whisking constantly, until
mixture becomes thick (about 10 minutes).  If you have a thermometer, it should register 170F, otherwise, it should 
coat the back of a wookden spoon and leave a clear pass if you run your finger through it.  
The curd will thincken more once cooled.   

Remove from heat and immediately strain mixture through a sieve.  Add butter and whisk until completely melted
and incorporated and mixture is smooth.

Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Sometimes a "skin" can form on the surface ofthe curd.  To prevent it,
press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface. 

Keep in airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or freeze up to 2 months.
