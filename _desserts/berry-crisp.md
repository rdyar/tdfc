Topping:  
2/3 cup old fashioned oats  
2/3 cup all purpose flour  
1/4 cup light brown sugar  
1/3 cup granulated sugar  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted  

Filling:  
5 cups frozen mixed berries (or just about two 10-oz bags)  
1 teaspoon lemon juice  
1/4 cup granulated sugar  
1/4 cup all purpose flour  

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 9 1/2 deep dish pie plate or similar sized baking dish. Set aside.  

In a large bowl, combine oats, flour, sugars, salt and cinnamon.  Add melted butter and stir until well combined.  Transfer to the freezer for a few minutes while you assemble the fruit filling.  

In a large bowl, combine all filling ingredients.  Stir gently until well combined.  Dump into prepared baking dish.  

Sprinkle the topping over the berries (pressing some of it together with your fingers to form clumps).  Bake for 40-50 minutes until the fruit is bubbling and juicy and the topping is light golden brown.  Cool slightly, serve warm with vanilla ice cream.
