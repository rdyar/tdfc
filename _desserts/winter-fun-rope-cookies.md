1 1/4 cups flour  
1/2 cup sugar  
1/4 teaspoon salt  
1/2 teaspoon baking powder  
1 teaspoon vanilla, almond or lemon extract  
5 tablespoons butter, softened  
1 egg  

In large mixer bowl, combine all ingredients. Beat at medium speed until dough forms, about 5 
minutes. Chill 2 hours or up to 2 days. 

Shape dough into 1/4 inch thick ropes about 3-4 inches long. Shape into bells, angels, candy 
canes, wreaths, candles, or any shape. Decorate with sugar sprinkles or any other decorations. 

Bake on ungreased cookie sheets at 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes. Cool cookies 1 minute 
before carefully removing from cookie sheet. 

This recipe can be doubled. Use food coloring to color dough if you wish. Cookies freeze well.
