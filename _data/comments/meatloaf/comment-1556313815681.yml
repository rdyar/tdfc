  If I am going to make meatloaf, I want enough for sandwiches.  So I use 1 lb
  of ground beef plus 1 lb of either ground pork or turkey.  I use either bread
  crumbs or oats for filler; I use milk or tomato sauce for a binder.  I
  frequently add grated carrots.  There are many recipes for meatloaf and I try
  them all.  There is a special pan for meatloaf that keeps it from sitting in
  the fat as it bakes but I have yet to get one.
